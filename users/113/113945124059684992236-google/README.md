But finally, her lifespan reached its end and she died in his arms.

But since her death, every night he dreamed about a girl praying inside a room made of stone. 10 days passed and he reminiscences about the bird while playing with his acoustic guitar the song they used to sing together. Then suddenly the area around his bed began to shine, and the scenery around him changed.
